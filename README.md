# financial-statement-wizard

"Create a web application that can calculate indirect cash flows. The application should take into account relevant financial statements such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. It should be able to input the necessary financial data and output the indirect cash flow statements, including the numerator and denominator calculations, along with a brief summary of the results. The application should also include error handling and data validation to ensure accurate calculations and user input. Provide a detailed prompt for a human developer to build the application, including the key features, functionality, and technical requirements." This modified prompt provides a clear problem statement, specific requirements, and necessary details for ChatGPT to generate a well-defined and accurate prompt for creating an indirect cash flow calculation web app. By using specific terminology and asking for detailed requirements, the query is less open-ended and more likely to produce a precise and accurate result.
